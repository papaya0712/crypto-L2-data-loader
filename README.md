# A Rust repository for automatic and efficient L2 crypto market data streaming, processing, and storage.

## 🧩 Description

This project provides a high-performance, asynchronous data pipeline for real-time **Level 2 (order book)** data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. It connects to WebSocket APIs, processes incoming data, and stores it for downstream analysis or archival.

---
## 🚀 Features

- Efficient WebSocket connections using [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- Subscription to multiple L2 data feeds
- Real-time parsing and processing of order book updates
- Optional persistent storage (e.g., local file, database) – *[placeholder]*
- Exchange-agnostic design – easily extendable for multiple APIs
- Unit-tested components for stability

---
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust (stable)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
