A Rust repository for automatic and efficient L2 crypto market data streaming, processing, and storage.

## 🧩 Description

This project provides a high-performance, asynchronous data pipeline for real-time **Level 2 (order book)** data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. It connects to WebSocket APIs, processes incoming data, and stores it for downstream analysis or archival.

- 📥 Subscription to multiple L2 data feeds
- 🧠 Real-time parsing and processing of order book updates
- 💾 Optional persistent storage (e.g., local file, database) – *[placeholder]*
- 🔧 Exchange-agnostic design – easily extendable for multiple APIs
- 🧪 Unit-tested components for stability
