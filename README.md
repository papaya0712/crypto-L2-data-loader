# A Rust repository for automatic and efficient L2 crypto market data streaming, processing, and storage.

## ðŸ§© Description

This project provides a high-performance, asynchronous data pipeline for real-time **Level 2 (order book)** data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. It connects to WebSocket APIs, processes incoming data, and stores it for downstream analysis or archival.

- Real-time parsing and processing of order book updates
- Optional persistent storage (e.g., local file, database) â€“ *[placeholder]*
- Exchange-agnostic design â€“ easily extendable for multiple APIs
- Unit-tested components for stability
